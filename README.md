# Headspring Konami Code

Hey you!

Yes, **_you_**

If you somehow managed to get *here*; this deep down in this abyss we call **_Internet_**, 
you must be **really bored** and I think you should **really get back to work**... 

Nevertheless, if you are still reading this and you have some time to spare trying **this '_library_'** 
I will much really appreciate it n.n

You just need to answer these few questions before you begin:

- Do you like Headspring?
- Do you like videogames?
- Do you like cheat codes?
- Do you like coding for fun?
- And lastly, do you like starting with 30 lives?

If you answered **_yes_** to everything, this '*library*' is for you.

## But seriously... What is *this* really supposed to do?

It will create a 'canvas' tag to display the Headspring logo programatically on the 'fixed' bottom right corner of the screen.

## Just remember:

Have fun!
